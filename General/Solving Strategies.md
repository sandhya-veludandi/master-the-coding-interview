# Solving Strategies
## Iterative
### Data Structures
1. Arrays
2. Strings
3. Linked Lists
4. Stacks + Queues
### Strategies
#### Pointers 
Note: pointers can begin anywhere in array (usually at first or last index)
* Basic: pointers for outer and inner for loop (usually O(n^2))
* Shifting Pointers: 
  * 2 pointers at first and last index, conditionally move either one inward (usually O(n))
* Skipping Pointers: 
  * pointers skip over certain indices depending on condition
#### Hashmaps
Note: used to store 2 pieces information (key and value) 
## Recursion
### Data Structures
1. 2d Arrays
2. Binary Trees
3.  Heaps
4. Graphs
### Algorithmic Approaches
1. Sorting
2. Greedy Method
3. Divide & Conquer
4. Dynamic Programming
5. Backtracking
